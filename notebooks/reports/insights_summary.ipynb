       "872   Hello, I’m facing a problem with the BOA Mobile app. Every time I enter my phone number and password, the app crashes and shows an error that says “BoaMobile closed because this app has a bug.” I tried updating, reinstalling, and clearing cache, but nothing worked. Please fix this bug in the next update. I really need access to my account. Thank you.   \n",
